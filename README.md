# SustainGame
Sustain Game is a Android application developed by myself(Quinn Banet), Sara Attarzadeh, and Valencia Richard.

# Why?
Sustain game was created in an effort to bring "green" awareness to a fun, social application. 

# Use Cases
With this application you can:
- log in through Facebook
- view your created challenges or public challenges
  - in public challenges you're presented with a list of current and past(called completed) challenges of which you can view progress, name, dates, and creator
  - in created challenges you're presented a list of challenges that you created
- this application uses your location to present the correct list to you (currently just Louisville and Lexignton, KY)
